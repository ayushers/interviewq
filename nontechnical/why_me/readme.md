# Why are you a good fit for this role?

**gapoorva**:

As a developer, I honed my programming skills and philosophy in cultures that encourage shipping code. As a result, I’m comfortable taking initiative and ownership on projects. As an engineer at X, I built Y from a hobby prototype into a production-ready microservice in three months. When I left for the summer, I handed off a system that handled over Z times the amount of production level traffic supported by X at the time. I look to take a similar degree of ownership with projects at W.

I wrote the shortening service in Golang, and in the course of development I also utilized a variety of DevOps tools like A, B, C, D, and more – all of which I had no prior experience with. Similarly, in my internship with E in 2015 and F in 2014, I worked with languages like G, H, I, and J that were all new to me. Situations like these bring out my best work because I excel at quickly picking up new skills and delivering measurable results. I enjoy working in environments where I’m constantly learning more about computers and technology, and I would capitalize on an opportunity to learn from X engineers.

I find the business problems that X solves really compelling. Your product verticals in N, M and P fundamentally change the dynamic between businesses and their customers. T software isn’t always as widely recognized as U applications, but I think the reach is enormous, especially when thousands of direct X customers use the software to do better business with millions of customers. As an engineer, I find great satisfaction with solving problems that helps real people and has great impact.
