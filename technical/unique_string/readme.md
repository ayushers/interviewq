# Unique Characters in a String

Given a string a, determine if every character in the string is unique (aka no duplicates). Write different solutions for the following scenarios:

1. You must operate in linear time
2. The input cannot be modified, but you must operate in constant space
3. The input can be modified, but you must operate in constant space and better time than O(N^2)

Example:

`"repeated"` should return `false`
`"not same"` should return `true`
